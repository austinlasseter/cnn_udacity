Notebook: Linear Autoencoder
It's suggested that you open the notebook in a new, working tab and continue working on it as you go through the instructional videos in this tab. This way you can toggle between learning new skills and coding/applying new skills.

To open this notebook, you have two options:

Go to the next page in the classroom (recommended).
Clone the repo from Github and open the notebook Simple_Autoencoder_Exercise.ipynb in the autoencoder > linear-autoencoder folder. You can either download the repository with git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git, or download it as an archive file from this link.
