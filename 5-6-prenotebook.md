Notebook: Weight Initialization
Now, you're ready to try out a weight initialization method that you define.

To open this notebook, you have two options:

Go to the next page in the classroom (recommended).
Clone the repo from Github and open the notebook weight_initialization_exercise.ipynb in the weight-initialization folder. You can either download the repository with git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git, or download it as an archive file from this link.
Instructions
Load in the FashionMNIST data
Define a function to initialize the weights of your model, taking values from a normal distribution
See how a model without any explicit weight initialization performs
This is a self-assessed lab. If you need any help or want to check your answers, feel free to check out the solutions notebook in the same folder, or by clicking here.
